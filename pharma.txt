Not every stock is plunging because of worries about the impact of the coronavirus. Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), for example, is up by a double-digit percentage. The big biotech announced this week that it's moving forward with late-stage clinical studies for its antiviral drug targeting treatment of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease.

Several smaller biotech stocks have also performed very well recently. Inovio Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:INO), Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA), and Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX) are scrambling to test their experimental coronavirus vaccines. Intense investor interest in these companies' clinical efforts has created buying pressure for all three stocks.

But the biggest winner from the coronavirus outbreak is a stock that most investors have never even heard of. Its shares have skyrocketed more than 1,600% so far in 2020. This under-the-radar stock with white-hot momentum is Co-Diagnostics (NASDAQ:CODX).
